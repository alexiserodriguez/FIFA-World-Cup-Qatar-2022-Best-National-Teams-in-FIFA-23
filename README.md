# FIFA WC Qatar 2022 Best National Teams in FIFA 23 Analysis
In this project, I developed an analysis and visualization from the FIFA 23 players dataset. The dataset was collected from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashncarry/fifa-23-complete-player-dataset'>Kaggle</a> and cleaned with Excel. The main objective from this analysis was to analyze what are the top 5 national teams according to their players overall and the best lineups that they could form. The following repository includes files from a Data Analysis that was done using Python and Excel.
